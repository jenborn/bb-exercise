## Welcome to bb-exercise

This is a simple project built in PHP/Javascript/HTML/CSS with some help from Foundation 6 for style.

To view, simply download and put anywhere you can run PHP.  Going to the root index will allow you to "logout," which will send a request to the PHP class for the session to be unset before redirecting you to an external url.  Going to /account will allow you to click Edit Account, Delete Account, or Logout.

Please let me know if you have any questions and enjoy!
